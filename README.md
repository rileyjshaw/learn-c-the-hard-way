A few rushed (and often incomplete) answers from the early days of [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/). I was mostly studying the lesson format; I was working on an experiential learning platform at the time.

If you're actually looking for help on Learn C The Hard Way, there are almost certainly better repos than this one :)
